# web-scraping-challenge
Scrape four websites for Mission to Mars info and display results on an html page using Flask and MongoDB.

### Scraping

Used Splinter to visit [Red Planet Science](https://redplanetscience.com) and used BeautifulSoup to parse through the html. Used a for loop to search html results and append to the list of titles and teasers.

Next, visited [Mars Space Images](https://spaceimages-mars.com) and in the same way found the url for Mars image of the day.

After that used Pandas to read the html on the [Mars Galaxy Facts](https://galaxyfacts-mars.com) page and created a data frame out of one of the tables found on the page. Lightly formatted the table, creating a new index and relabeling the index column. Then exported to html that included some table styling.

Lastly, and the most challenging part of the project for me, was to once again use Splinter and BeautifulSoup to find the title and image links for the four hemispheres of Mars on [Mars Hemispheres](https://marshemispheres.com). With getting partial information but not able to cycle through the pages effectively, I started at the end, making sure I could parse the html and find the information I needed on one individual page. Once I knew that was working I ended up creating a list of the four webpages I needed to visit, and then looped through those to build a new dictionary of titles and image urls.

### MongoDB and Flask App

Asked to recreate a webpage that will use the information I scraped above. I set up the Flask app, built the html layout with the help of Bootstrap, and turned the Jupyter Notebook I used for writing my code for scraping, into a python file and created a function that returned a dictionary of values that I had scraped so could feed those into MongoDB and populate my webpage. 

Another challenge was getting the html page to load before doing the first scrape. Flask always had an error saying the variables I created were "None" so the html page would not render. This wasn't the case in any of our class demonstrations so I was at a loss. But eventually decided on creating an if/else statement in the app to force it to renderâ€”if mars_data is empty, then reference this empty dictionary of mars_data.

Lots learned during this project. Particularly imporoving my problem-solving skills and how to narrow down where the error is originating from to help focus in on the best solution.
